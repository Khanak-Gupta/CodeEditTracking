This project is a real-time collaborative code editor built with React, Node.js, and Socket.IO. 
It enables multiple users to write, edit, and view code simultaneously with instant synchronization across all connected clients. 
Designed as a lightweight yet powerful example of real-time web applications, 
it demonstrates the core principles of WebSockets, event-driven architecture, and collaborative coding platforms.
